# DinoManager
A little program I made to help playing dnd as a Dinosaur themed shepard druid who summoned more Velociraptors than feasible to roll attacks for.
To test it out, just click New then Import Dino list from Default
Then you can modify the target Armor Class, toggle on or off relevant damage resistances, then click attack or attack with advantage to roll some digital D20s and determine which dinosaur hits, with all the damage being calculated at the bottom.
Then if you need to change the Armor class again, click the calculate button to recalculate without attacking again.
Also to the right you can see the very overpowered extra critical hit effects tracker that we used. You can't turn it off since this was never ment to be anything other than a tool for me to use.

You can modify the dinolist as a textfile with each dino's name.

Each dinosaur has a unique personality. Example: Sir Hank was nobel and wore a bucket like a knight helmet.
Sniffles was the party's favorite.
